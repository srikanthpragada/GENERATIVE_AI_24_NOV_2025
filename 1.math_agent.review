# Code Review for 1.math_agent.py

## Overview
This script defines a mathematical agent using tools for multiplication, addition, and division, and then invokes it with a HumanMessage. The following points are suggestions for improvements and best practices.

## Suggestions

1. **Function Annotations**:
   - Consider using more descriptive types for function arguments and return types. For example, for the `divide` function, you could indicate that division by zero can occur. Adding a return type of `Optional[float]` might clarify this if you handle the zero division case.

2. **Zero Division Handling**:
   - In the `divide` function, you should handle the case where `b` is zero to prevent a `ZeroDivisionError`. This could be done by raising an exception or returning a special value (e.g. `None`), with a corresponding message.
   ```python
   def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Optional[float]:
       if b == 0:
           raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
       return a / b
   ```

3. **Docstrings**:
   - The docstrings are currently brief. Consider providing more detail, such as what the function returns and examples of usage. A good standard is to include type information in the docstring.
   - Example:
   ```python
   """
   Multiply a and b.

   Args:
       a (int): The first integer.
       b (int): The second integer.

   Returns:
       int: The product of a and b.

   Example:
       >>> multiply(2, 3)
       6
   """
   ```

4. **HumanMessage Input**:
   - The invocation of `agent.invoke()` currently uses a hard-coded `HumanMessage`. Consider making this more dynamic and user-friendly, allowing for user input or external command arguments.

5. **Response Handling**:
   - The way you print messages in the response could be improved for better clarity. You might want to handle empty responses or format the output more cleanly.
   - Example:
   ```python
   if response['messages']:
       for message in response['messages']:
           print(message.pretty_print())
   else:
       print("No response received.")
   ```

6. **Imports**:
   - Ensure that all imports are necessary and there's no redundant code. It seems `langchain_core.messages` and `langchain_core.tools` both have potential imports that can be simplified.

7. **Comments**:
   - While the code is mostly self-explanatory, consider adding comments that explain the purpose of larger code blocks or any complex logic.

8. **Testing**:
   - There are no unit tests included for the functions. It would be beneficial to implement some test cases to validate the functionality of `add`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions.
   - You could use Python’s built-in `unittest` framework or another testing framework like `pytest`.

## Conclusion
The overall structure of the code is solid, with clear functionality. By addressing these suggestions, the code can improve in terms of robustness, readability, and user interaction.
